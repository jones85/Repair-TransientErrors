# 19/01 Warning

I've created the script after I had 'Transient Errors' on a an S2D cluster.  Therefore, full disclousure, I haven't tested this script yet as I do not have a testing environment.
if you have a testing environment, please feel free to run this and do leave comments and feedback (it's the only way I'll learn)

Otherwise, you are running this **at your own risk** and you have been warned.

## 23/01 Tested

Script tested on a live HCI environment.  The disk was repaired with no issues. However, the above still applies.
